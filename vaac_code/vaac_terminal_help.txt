This is the Vaac terminal. It provides an interface to use Vaac. You can type into this terminal, or speak into it. Because of inherent inaccuracies in speech recognition, the terminal will not prompt messages for commands that do not make 'sense'.

This terminal accepts simple, natural language commands.

You can provide one argument to help:
    > help [code|firefox|gedit|nautilus|terminal]
to get a list of commands supported for each application.

You can use up and down to navigate through commands history, and page up and page down to scroll. Use backspace to delete a typed character.
For more information, use the README.md file, or go to the Vaac github page.
