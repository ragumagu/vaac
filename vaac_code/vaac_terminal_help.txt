This is the Vaac terminal. It provides an interface to communicate with your system. You can type into this terminal, or speak into it. This is a primitive terminal and might not support all key strokes.

This terminal accepts simple, natural language commands.

You can provide one argument to help: 
    > help [code|firefox|gedit|nautilus|terminal]
to get a list of commands supported for each application.

You can use up and down to navigate through commands history, and page up and page down to scroll. Use backspace to delete a typed character.
For more information, use the README.md file, or go to the Vaac github page.
