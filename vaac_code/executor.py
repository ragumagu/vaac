'''This is the Executor module.
    Usage:
        This works on Linux systems with X. Requires wmctrl and xdotool to
        be installed.
        The run method takes in, a list argument with:
            command[0] = 'key' or 'open' or 'focus'
            command[1] = 'key_stroke_string'
            command[2] = 'target_application_name'
        target_application_name is optional. If not mentioned, the key strokes
        are directed to current window.
        The key_stroke string is not included, when using 'open' or 'focus'.
        Usage examples:
            # Send key stroke to app:
            >>> executor.run(['key','ctrl+a', 'app'])
            # Open app:
            >>> executor.run(['open','app'])
            # Focus app window.
            >>> executor.run(['focus','app'])
