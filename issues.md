1. vaac does not cycle through windows.
3. If no argument is provided to 'focus', it still focuses extractor.current_application.
4. Organize the 'window manager' changes, so that they can be toggled on and off, for when you make a gui or when you want to hide the terminal and still use vaac in the background.
5. There is no way to peek at the commands list by vaac.
6. Vaac does not recognize equivalent sentences.
7. Vaac does not wait till user completes command.
8. Request for higher speech recognition accuracy and larger vocabulary.
9. Vaac does not ask for confirmation, it does not have 'yes','no','repeat' in vocabulary.
10. Vaac does not improve itself. Training is not automated. Recording and vaac_terminal are not integrated.
11. Vaac does not provide a type-able command line-like interface.
12. Vaac does not support sending individual keystrokes by voice.
13. Extractor does not have a clear set of rules which devs can read. Implement multiple layers of filters in the extractor. Make the code readable. Some of the logic regarding fuzzy ratios has to be cleared up: which ones must be used, and what is the weightage that is to be given to each deduction.
14. "copy and paste" vs "find and replace"
15. "switch to tab two"
16. "open new tab" "new tab" | "exit full screen" "toggle full screen" -> "full screen"
17. "close nautilus" vs "close tab"

18. ~~xdotool does not activate the correct window. And might give: XGetWindowProperty[_NET_WM_DESKTOP] failed (code=1)
    Try the following solution: focus all the windows one by one, with ids in 
    xdotool search -class "app-name"
    till there are none of the above failed error.
    Implement this, in such a way, that windows of the same app can be cycle through.~~

19. Some errors generated by windows opened by vaac get printed in the terminal. To solve this issue, redirect the errors to /dev/null, in the Popen line.
